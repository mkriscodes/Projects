                    <h2>ECG on your wrist. Anytime. Anywhere.</h2>
                    <p>With the ECG app, Apple Watch Series 6 is capable of generating an ECG similar to a single-lead electrocardiogram.2 It’s a momentous achievement for a wearable device that can provide critical data for doctors and peace of mind for
                        you.
                    </p>
                    <p2>Your finger can tell you a lot about your heart. Electrodes built into the Digital Crown and the back crystal work together with the ECG app to read your heart’s electrical signals. Simply touch the Digital Crown to generate an ECG
                        waveform in just 30 seconds. The ECG app can indicate whether your heart rhythm shows signs of atrial fibrillation — a serious form of irregular heart rhythm — or sinus rhythm, which means your heart is beating in a normal pattern

                    <p>The Always-On Retina display is now significantly brighter outdoors when your wrist is down. So you can see all the information on your watch face more easily than ever — without having to raise your wrist to wake your watch.</p>
